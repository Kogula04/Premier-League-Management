# Premier League Management

System maintains number of football clubs which play in the primer league and provide user with information such as scheduled matches, existing clubs, their rankings and scores.

I create a menu based on command line interface based input and give the user the choice of:
1. Create a new club and add it to league
2. Delete an existing club from league
3. Display statistics for club
4. Display the premier league table
5. Add a played match
6. Save data
7. Exit

Design and implement a graphical user interface (GUI) which is able to do the following:

- Sorting the premier league table according to points, goals scored, number of wins (descending order).

- Add a button (Search) and a textbox which can be used to search for all matches played in a given date 
and also add button which every time it is pressed it generates one random played match between two randomly chosen clubs (teams) and 
it automatically updates the premier league table by adding the match (points, score and other statistics).
